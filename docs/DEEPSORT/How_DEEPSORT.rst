How does it Work?
++++++++++++++++++

DeepSORT is a real time object **tracker**
It is an extension to SORT (Simple Online Realtime Tracker) by adding another distance metric.
The algorithm works in two parts:
- Detection: All objects are detected in the frame.
- Association: By looking at distance and predicted velocity a matching is performed for similar detections with respect to the previous frame. 

This allows objects to be tracked and given a particular ID. 

Deep SORT tracks the objects as opposed to YOLO which also results in smoother object detection
 as YOLO recalculates all boxes every frame of the video and doesnâ€™t know if an object is the same one or different from the previous frame.
